## Important Guidelines

### Objectivity and Rigor

- **Evidence-Based**: Every major claim should cite specific sections, tables, or figures
- **Distinguish Claims from Evidence**: Mark whether something is proven, demonstrated, or claimed
- **Acknowledge Uncertainty**: Use confidence indicators when appropriate
- **Balanced Assessment**: Include both strengths and weaknesses
- **No Unwarranted Extrapolation**: Stay within what the paper actually demonstrates

### Citation Standards

- Use format: `[§3.2]` for sections, `[Table 2]` for tables, `[Figure 4]` for figures
- When inferring: `[Inferred from §3.2: ...]`
- When interpreting: `[One interpretation of §4.1: ...]`
- When unsure: `[Unclear from paper: ...]`

### Evidence Level Tags

Apply these consistently:

- `[PROVEN]` - Formally proven, mathematically rigorous
- `[EMPIRICAL]` - Supported by experimental data with statistical validation
- `[DEMONSTRATED]` - Shown via case study, prototype, or example
- `[CLAIMED]` - Asserted without strong evidence
- `[SPECULATIVE]` - Forward-looking, hypothetical, or future work

### Confidence Indicators

When making assessments, indicate confidence:

- **High Confidence**: Strong evidence, clear results, robust methodology
- **Medium Confidence**: Reasonable evidence, some limitations
- **Low Confidence**: Limited evidence, significant concerns, requires verification

### Practical Focus

- Prioritize insights that bridge academic research and practical engineering
- Focus on actionable takeaways over theoretical details
- Assess real-world applicability, not just novelty
- Consider cost/benefit from engineering perspective
- Identify prerequisites and barriers to adoption

### Critical Thinking

- Question methodology and evidence quality
- Look for confounding factors and alternative explanations
- Assess generalizability carefully
- Don't assume industry relevance without evidence
- Distinguish correlation from causation
- Consider what's NOT said in the paper

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Accepting claims uncritically**: Always assess evidence quality
2. **Ignoring methodology**: How something was studied matters as much as results
3. **Overgeneralizing**: Small studies may not apply broadly
4. **Missing context**: Results are often context-dependent
5. **Overlooking limitations**: Authors may understate weaknesses
6. **Confusing novelty with utility**: Novel ≠ practically useful
7. **Ignoring alternatives**: Compare against baselines and other approaches
8. **Skipping validation**: Check if claims are actually supported by data
9. **Missing the forest for trees**: Focus on insights engineers can use
10. **Uncited assertions**: All major points should have citations

## Output Format

- Use well-formatted Markdown with clear headings
- Include tables for comparisons and structured data
- Use bullet points for lists and key points
- Bold key terms and important findings
- Use blockquotes for direct paper quotes (with citations)
- Include evidence tags consistently
- Make it scannable - engineers should be able to quickly find relevant insights
